# Naming Convention for Minecraft Items and Blocks

In Minecraft, when referencing items or blocks in commands or code, spaces are typically replaced with underscores (_). 
This convention helps maintain consistency and readability, especially when dealing with multiple-word names.

For example:
- `diamond_block` instead of `Diamond Block`
- `iron_sword` instead of `Iron Sword`


When using the Minecraft Items API v2 to fetch item and block data, you must follow the naming convention. In particular, item/block names spaces should be replaced with with underscores (_).
