# FishTracker

A Minecraft Fabric mod that automatically tracks your caught fish on CosmosMc and sends the data to a remote API for statistics and analysis.

## Overview

FishTracker is designed to enhance your fishing experience on the CosmosMc server by automatically logging your catches. It parses in-game chat messages to detect fish catches, including their rarity, and securely transmits this data to a remote API using encryption.

The mod provides a user-friendly configuration GUI accessible via a keybind, allowing you to set up your credentials and preferences without editing configuration files manually.

## Key Benefits

- **Seamless Tracking**: No manual logging required; the mod handles everything automatically.
- **Secure Data Transmission**: Uses Fernet encryption to protect your data.
- **Customizable**: Configure settings to suit your needs.
- **Debug Support**: Enable debug mode for troubleshooting.

Get started by installing the mod and configuring it with your API credentials.
